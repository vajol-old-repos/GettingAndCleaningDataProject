<h1>Study Design</h1>

<h2>How the data has been collected</h2>

<p>This data set is a result of an experiment, carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six different activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. </p>

<p>The data were captured by using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope.The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.</p>

<h1>Code Book</h1>

<h2>Attribute Information</h2>

<p>The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix &#39;t&#39; to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. </p>

<p>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). </p>

<p>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the &#39;f&#39; to indicate frequency domain signals). </p>

<p>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:<br/>
&#39;-XYZ&#39; is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.</p>

<p>tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ

<p>The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: </p>

<p>mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.</p>

<p>Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:</p>

<p>gravityMean

tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. </p>

<p>The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. </p>

<h2>Attribute Information</h2>

<p>For each record in the dataset it is provided: </p>

<ul>
<li>Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. </li>
<li>Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. </li>
<li>A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. </li>
<li>Its activity label. </li>
<li>An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transformations information</h2>

<p>Here is a list of transformations performed on the raw data sets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add column names to activity labels table</li>
<li>Convert factor values to character for easier manipulation</li>
<li>Remove special signs from column names</li>
<li>Make variable names stand out by using mixed case</li>
<li>Bind together test data sets: activities + subjects + features</li>
<li>Bind together train data sets: activities + subjects + features</li>
<li>Merge (APPEND) together both data sets: test + train</li>
<li>Add column names to the new data set (using file &ldquo;features.txt&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Merge activity labels set with features to produce the complete set with descriptive names for activities</li>
<li>Extract only measurements on the mean and standard deviation</li>
<li>Bind together and create final set with columns on the mean and standard deviation, subjects and activities</li>
<li>Create melted data set with descriptive activity names</li>
<li>Cast the melted dataset according calculating average value for each variable, per subject and activity</li>
<li>Create final data file with the tidy dataset</li>
</ul>
